A Real Time Bus Tracking System using PHP

This is the Web part of the system which points the Bus on a map using recently added data.
I have all these raw data scattered through out, it's easy to understand.

There are two parts of this system Admin and Parent.
    -Admin part is labelled under BusHome.php 
    -Parent part is labelled under parent_home.php
